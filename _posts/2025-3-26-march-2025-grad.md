Congratulations to our bachelor students Naoshi, Kazuma, and Izumi, as well as our masters student Ishida on graduating this week!

Ishida is the pioneer student that kickstarted Prof Sakti's tenure at Waseda University, winning awards for our lab and contributing multiple papers, as well as setting the stage for our current and future students to grow in a fulfilling learning environment. Thank you so much for the past 3 years you were with us, and best of luck with your future endeavors!
Izumi, Kazuma, and Naoshi are going to pursue their masters at Saktilab and continue to contribute to our laboratory. 

Congratulations again everyone and best of luck!
