At the end of last year, 3 of our B4 students went on exchange to the Bandung Institute of Technology hosted by Prof. Muhamad Abdulkadir Martoprawiro and Dr. Ganes Shukri!

They continued their research topic there, while learning about new MD methods and software. Besides research, one of the highlights was making new friends at the university, providing them with plenty of cultural exchange as well.

They also learned some local slang, to quote Kazuma - "SERU ANJAYYYYYY!!"
