  description: 
    Lithium-sulfur batteries are a promising alternative to 
    traditional lithium-ion technology due to their high 
    energy density, lightweight design, and lower cost. Utilizing 
    sulfur as the cathode allows for greater storage capacity. 
    However, key challenges include short cycle life and capacity 
    fading, primarily caused by polysulfide shuttling during charge 
    and discharge cycles. Research focuses on addressing these 
    issues to unlock their full potential for energy storage.

- title: Targeting Mutant BMPR2 for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
  subtitle: Identifying and Analyzing Candidate Compounds to Address BMPR2 Mutations in PAH

  description: 
    Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor type II (BMPR2) is 
    a receptor of bone forming protein and a transmembrane 
    protein that forms dimer. It is known that certain BMPR2 
    mutations cause Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). 
    However, there is no effective treatments for PAH against 
    mutated BMPR2. The purpose of this research is to search 
    for candidate compounds for mutant BMPR2 and and analyze 
    their interactions with BMPR2.

  description: 
    NASICON, Na super Ionic Conductors for short, has compositional 
    formulas which contain metal and polyanion 
    Na<sub>x</sub>M<sub>2</sub>(A<sub>O</sub>â‚„)<sub>3</sub>. 
    The purpose of this research is to search for solid-state 
    electrolytes with higher ionic conductivity and less toxic 
    atoms using Density Functional Tight Binding Molecular Dynamics (DFTBMD).
