- title: Unlocking the Potential of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries
  subtitle: Overcoming Cycle Life and Capacity Challenges for Next-Generation Energy Storage
  image: images/projects/LiS_bat.png
  link: 
  description: 
    Lithium-sulfur batteries are a promising alternative to 
    traditional lithium-ion technology due to their high 
    energy density, lightweight design, and lower cost. Utilizing 
    sulfur as the cathode allows for greater storage capacity. 
    However, key challenges include short cycle life and capacity 
    fading, primarily caused by polysulfide shuttling during charge 
    and discharge cycles. Research focuses on addressing these 
    issues to unlock their full potential for energy storage.

- title: Carbonylative Polymerization of Undecenol
  subtitle: Catalyst Design for Producing Linear Polyesters from Undecenol
  image: images/projects/undecenol.png
  link: 
  description: 
    This research investigates the carbonylative polymerization 
    of undec-10-en-1-ol, catalyzed by HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub>, to produce 
    polydodecyloate, a key material for biodegradable plastics. 
    A major challenge lies in preventing backbiting reactions that 
    lead to cyclic polymers. By modifying the catalyst's ligands with 
    P(OPh)<sub>3</sub>, PPh<sub>3</sub>, and PMe<sub>3</sub>, the 
    study seeks to promote linear polymer formation, optimizing the 
    reaction for sustainable polymer production.

- title: Targeting Mutant BMPR2 for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
  subtitle: Identifying and Analyzing Candidate Compounds to Address BMPR2 Mutations in PAH
  image: images/projects/bmpr2.jpg
  link: 
  description: 
    Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor type II (BMPR2) is 
    a receptor of bone forming protein and a transmembrane 
    protein that forms dimer. It is known that certain BMPR2 
    mutations cause Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). 
    However, there is no effective treatments for PAH against 
    mutated BMPR2. The purpose of this research is to search 
    for candidate compounds for mutant BMPR2 and and analyze 
    their interactions with BMPR2.
